# Early-Detection-of-Curable-Diabetic-Retinopathy-From-Retinal-Images
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication caused in the retina of diabetic patients. The patients who are diagnosed with type I and type II Diabeties having irregular blood sugar levels are more prone to this disease. 1) This work explores the implementation of automated feature extraction making use of Convolutional Neural Networks with transfer learning to detect Diabetic Retinopathy in the retinal images. 2) The images are classified into 5 classes. CLAHE along with other techniques are used for pre-processing. 3) The implementation results provided a model classification accuracy of 89% meanwhile adhering to reduced computational complexity and processing time thus providing a robust and efficient model to the practitioners to effectively detect Diabetic Retinopathy.
